snippets
========

A repo of snippets that may turn out to be useful... Just have a look instead of reading the stupid intro.

Licensing
=========

These are snippets... In case you missed it, that means they all have their own licenses. For portability, 
this means that each file has its license included at the bottom or top of the file.

Graduation
==========

Should a snippet `advance sufficiently` | `become interesting enough to me` | `gain a larger interest from 
others` I will remove it from the repository and give it a repository of its own in order to allow for larger 
and separate development to occur.

Dependencies
============

Other than a `gcc`-compatible C compiler (ie: `gcc`, `clang`, etc.), and the usual (`coreutils`, `less`, 
`make`, a decent shell, etc.) , nothing really. Use `make` to build (your files will appear in `build/` and 
the `readme` will appear onscreen), and use `make clean` to clean up.
