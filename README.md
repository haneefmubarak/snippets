snippets
========

A repo of snippets that may turn out to be useful... Just have a look instead of reading the stupid intro.

Licensing
=========

These are snippets... In case you missed it, that means they all have their own licenses. For portability, 
this means that each file has its license included at the bottom or top of the file.

Graduation
==========

Should a snippet `advance sufficiently` | `become interesting enough to me` | `gain a larger interest from 
others` I will remove it from the repository and give it a repository of its own in order to allow for larger 
and separate development to occur.

Dependencies
============

Other than a `gcc`-compatible C compiler (ie: `gcc`, `clang`, etc.), and the usual (`coreutils`, `less`, 
`make`, a decent shell, etc.) , nothing really. Use `make` to build (your files will appear in `build/` and 
the `readme` will appear onscreen), and use `make clean` to clean up.

Contributions
=============

While I do appreciate contributions, relicensing becomes a hassle when a large amount of edits have occurred.
Therefore, should you choose to contribute, you irrevocably assign me all rights to your contribution. That 
said, I feel that it is only fair that you are recognized for your work, so any work you do will be put into a 
logfile named after your username in a contributors folder (don't do this, I will). Should any snippet(s) 
containing your contributions graduate, I'll copy the relevant logs to the new project/repo.

In terms of commit style, commit one set of self-relevant changes to one file at a time, unless doing so will 
break something. Write a commit message along the lines of "blah blah blah in file x" (the "in file x" part is 
mandatory). If you must (as outlined above) commit multiple files, write the names of the files (with spaces 
for separators) in the summary, and write a commit message as outlined above in the extended description 
(leave an empty line between each file's message).
